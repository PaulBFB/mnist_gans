# Generative Adversarial Networks

> Authors: Matthias Sammer, Paul Leitner

We show a theoretical summary of the principles of GANs in the [html file](./Generative Adversarial Networks.html) . 
To make it a little more tangible, we also created a small convenience wrapper class that shows the process in python in the [python file](./mnist_gan.py)

For the practical implementation we use tensorflow on a Keras backend, note that the training process on a CPU takes multiple hours, this could be expedited by using the GPU backend by at least an order of magnitude
